# Project Overview

Using the Dog Breed Data set, create a small application that allows the user to view and add to the data set. The data should be hosted in RestDB following the instructions provided. The site should have two tabs: Index, for showing the full list of Dog Breeds, and Add, for adding more Dog Breeds to the list.

## Index
The Index page should display a card for every Dog Breed in the list. The card must contain all data from that Dog Breeds entry in the database. In addition, the card should provide the option to delete that breed from the database.

## Add
The Add page should present a form with fields for every piece of data in a Dog Breed record. After the data has been entered and the user clicks “Submit”, the new Dog Breed should be added to the database and visible on the Index page.
